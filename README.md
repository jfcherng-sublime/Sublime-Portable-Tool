This tool is developed to manage the context menu, file icons,
file associations for Sublime Text/Merge under Windows.

It also allows you to replace your `notepad.exe` with Sublime Text.
To do it, you need to have `Microsoft Visual C++ 2010 Redistributable` installed on your PC.

## Usage

Take `Sublime-Text-Portable-Tool.exe` as the example.
For `Sublime-Merge-Portable-Tool.exe`, steps are quite the same.

1. Put `Sublime-Text-Portable-Tool.exe` along with the `sublime_text.exe`,
   whose default locations are under `C:\Program Files\Sublime Text 3` (ST 3)
   or `C:\Program Files\Sublime Text` (ST 4).
1. Execute `Sublime-Text-Portable-Tool.exe`.
1. Just enter the number for what you want to do as listed in the menu.
